# Symbols that are to be overwridden should be defined in the the makefile
# before "include mipshal.mk" or passed to make on the command line in the
# form 'make STACK=0x1000' or 'make FLASH_START=0xBFC00000'.
#
# Care should be taken to ensure that no pre-existing environment variables
# collide with the set of variables that this file inspects as unintended
# results may happen.
